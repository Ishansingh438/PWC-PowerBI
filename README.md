Created a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.

This GitHub repository showcases my work on a Power BI dashboard project for a telecom company. The objective was to create a comprehensive visualization tool to help the client gain insights into customer preferences and key performance indicators (KPIs).

🔍 Project Highlights:

✅ Data Visualization: I transformed raw telecom data into actionable insights by creating visually appealing charts, graphs, and reports.


📈 KPI Focus: The dashboard focuses on crucial KPIs such as customer satisfaction, call metrics, and agent performance to guide strategic decision-making.


🎨 Interactive Design: Users can filter and slice data, allowing for a dynamic exploration of telecom trends.


🔐 Data Security: I ensured data security and privacy compliance throughout the project.


🌐 Cross-Platform Access: The dashboard is accessible on Power BI Service for easy sharing and collaboration.


Project Goal :- 
To help our client gain valuable insights into customer preferences and key performance indicators (KPIs).

Task:-
It’s omnipresent: telecom marketing. Better price here. Better service there. Best for small businesses here. Best for young urbanites there. But what do customers really want? Our client, a big telecom company needs to know.

Create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.


 KPIs included :

• Overall customer satisfaction

• Overall calls answered/abandoned

• Calls by time

• Average speed of answer

• Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs  calls answered

                                                                        Customer Retention

I'm excited about the impact this project will have on our client's operations and their ability to better serve their customers.
